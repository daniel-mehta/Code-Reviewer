## Summary
This code calculates the factorials of numbers, and then calls a function to say hello with given names. Also it tries to call an undefined variable `n` in line 2 which will cause error if not initialized first time at runtime. In order for this program functionality is clear without any errors or exceptions we also need proper indentation but the main problem lies within its logic and structure, a recursive solution would be simpler considering that factorial of n can only grow smaller than itself (n*factorial(n-1)), so an iterative approach could work better in this case.
 
## Issues/Problems  
The above code fails to return any value from the `greet` function, it just prints hello without waiting for a newline character or else program terminates abruptly when executed after print statement due not calling greet(name) method again and hence no output. Also in recursive call of factorial() there is nothing returned so if we need to use this result later on then how can that be done?
  
## Improvements/Refactors 
```python
def calculate_factorial (n):    # refactor the function name for better readability and clear understanding. Use proper verb or noun names in place of 'calculate'. Also, use a loop instead to compute factorial if necessary as recursion could be overly complicated with multiple computations being done within each call
def greet(name="World"):        # add an optional parameter `default` for the name variable. Make it clear that this is also needed later on (easy in code review). Also use proper verb or noun names to follow Python naming rules â€“ snake_case, camelCase etc
def greet(name='World', default):   # add two parameters `default` and the parameter name. This allows both 'Daniel,' & not providing a value for it will be set as World (to maintain backward compatibility). Make an exception that would cause error in runtime if missing arguments, so ensure all necessary inputs are provided 
def greet():                      # remove print statement from function because we have already defined the name to say hello. It is done differently with default parameter values above or use return immediately inside this method as it will not do anything unless there's a next step in code which requires further action of `greet` (like returning value).
def greet(name):                 # remove unnecessary print statement from function because we have already defined the name to say hello. It is done differently with default parameter values above or use return immediately inside this method as it will not do anything unless there's a next step in code which requires further action of `greet` (like returning value).
``` 
This program lacks necessary functionality and could be improved for real-world usage. The factorial calculation is too simple, you need to keep multiplying the number by every integer less than it until one becomes zero or negative depending on your needs as recursion can lead into infinite loops if not handled properly in a normal scenario (as with large input). For larger inputs consider using an iterative approach for calculating factories.
