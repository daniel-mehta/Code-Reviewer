      "## Code Summary  \n",
      "The given Python code counts the number of word in an input text. However, it has few issues which need to be addressed before proceeding further as below - \n",
      "1) The variable `count` is initialized with zero but used for incrementing a count only once (it's not being re-initialized at every iteration).  2) This approach of splitting the string into an array and then counting elements in that list does add some overhead. It would be better to use builtin functions which are optimized already like `len()` or 'split'.\n",
      "3) No specific requirements about performance, logic errors etc., but from a maintainability point-of view it is considered good practice for the function/method name should reflect its purpose and functionality if any error occurs. In this case \"count_words\" might not be precise enough to clearly indicate what words are counted or why they're being done so in context of code reviewing, but we can rename as per best practices ie., `get_word_count`\n",
      "  \n",
      "## Technical Issues \n",
      "1) The function doesn‚Äôt handle leading/trailing spaces. If there is a word with space at the start or end it would count them twice (one for each). To fix this we should trim any trailing and starting white-spaces using `strip()` method in python but that will remove all other whitespaces including tabs, newlines etc., which might not be desired. \n",
      "2) The function does't handle special characters or punctuation if present at the end of a word (for instance \"-\" character). To tackle this problem would require more sophisticated string processing methods and handling such cases in specific way according to requirements may vary from one case that should count towards another, like ignoring these types.\n",
      "3) No explicit error checking is performed for out-of-memory errors or incorrect input type validation checks have been omitted but could be added based on the needs of our code reviewing team and it might affect performance if not handled properly when unexpected inputs are provided to this function/method in production level application codes, which will need proper handling according requirements.\n",
      "  \n",
      "## Required Changes \n",
      "1) To handle leading or trailing spaces: `words = text.strip().split()` This removes all space characters from both ends of the string and then splits them into a list with words separated by whitespace (if any). If you only want to count alphabetic word, remove .lower(), for example if we are counting lowercase or upper case letters separately: `words = [word.strip().lower() for word in text]`\n",
      "2) To handle special characters at end of a word - add regular expression matching here according the requirement like '[a-zA-Z0-9\\s][^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]*$' if you want to count words separately.  This would work for single and multiple spaces between two different types (eg: \"one\" , \"-two\", etc).\n",
      "3) Implement proper error checking in production code, e.g., check whether text is not `None` before proceeding with the operation or verify it's an instance of string type using Python‚Äôs built-in data structure like a list and if necessary handle different types/data cases accordingly as per requirement requirements provided by your team members for this stage in reviewing process to ensure code quality.\n",
